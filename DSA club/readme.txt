PREREQUISITES

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
Web browser with JavaScript enabled.

NOTE:
In some of the systems, the form I actually made is not represented as I made so kindly
zoom out to 50% on your browser(when the project is opened), if there is any distortion
with the heading, to get the actual look of what I made. I have attached the actual look
of the website as a screenshot in the email. THANK YOU
